List and No.for the proposed acqui sition of the zamindaries and tenures.Incidental to this primary object is the acquisition of the various interests in the land., the extent of the ability of Government to pay, the extent of the necessities of the proprietors and many other considerations, with which the Executive Government would be more familiar than the Legislature itself.1952 The State of Bikar v.1952 The State of JVEl v.denied to the proprietors equal protection of the laws guaranteed by article 14 of the Constitution.of such realization to the State exchequer.The whole purpose of the clause is to make the obligation to pay compensation a condition precedent to the compulsory acquisition of property.Section 43 of the Act empowers the State Government to make rules for carrying out the purposes of the Act.The Act further deals with the realization of arrears of rents due before the date of vesting of the estates to the zemindars and forfeits fifty per cent.In the present cases, it is untenable to state that the taking over of arrears of rent is a natural consequence of the acquisi tion of the estates.It arti ficially reduces the net income which is the basis of the assessment of compensation.In article 173, for instance, the word is clearly used in the sense of the Houses of legislature and excludes the Governor.1952 The Stat of Bihar v.1952 The Stat of Bihar v.1952 The Stau of Bihar v.1952 The Sta of Bihar v.The reference in the above quotation to the general 1 1915 L.Objection is next taken to the deduction of any amount under the head of works of

specious pka that the landlords must be supposed to spend that percentage of their gross income on works of benefit to the rayats of the estates and, therefore, that part of the Act is beyond the legislative competence of the Bihar Legislature.Article 31A relates back to the date of the Constitution and article 31B to the respective dates of the Acts and Regulations specified in the Ninth Schedule.The period of interval between the several instal ments.1018 SUPREME COURT REPORTS 1952 statute of Ohio was an impairment of the contract, forbidden by the 10th section of the first article of the Constitution of the United States.Furthermore, there is indication that the Constituent Assembly, representing the people of India which made the Constitution, was itself aware of the existence of legislation of the nature of impugned Act.I have already explained that in a scheme of land eforms such as is envisaged in the Act the acquisition of the arrears of rent may properly accompany the acquisition of the zamindaries and the tenures.The procedure for the acqui sition was prescribed in the Act itself.In the leading case of AttorneyGeneral v.of these arrears was for the private purpose of the zemindars and the other fifty per cent.This condition is implied in the provision of irticle 31 2 of the Constitution and although the enactment in the present case fulfills the requirements of clause 3 of article 31 and as 1952 The State of Bihar v.Section 13 provides for the management of the estates .That the acquisition of the estates not being for public purpose, the Act was unconstitutional.1790, has the following passage in discussing the con cluding clause of the Fifth Amendment of the American Constitution .The enunciation of this fundamental right necessarily requires a statement of the ambit and scope of the State action and to fix the ambit and scope of the State action it is necessary to specify the limitations on the State action, for that limitation alone i the measure of the fundamental right.In 1892, the legislature passed another Act authorising the City of Brooklyn to condemn the property of the company, provided the necessary proceedings were commenced within one year after the passing of the Act.It is said that the provision in the Act for the acquisition of arrears of rent is a fraud on the legis lative power given by the Constitution.Section 24 provides the manner of determination of the compensation payable to the proprietor or tenure holder.of the arrears of rent which are directed to be added to the compen sation.The title of the Act indicates that the law provides for some kind of land reform in Bihar.It cannot be supposed that the framers of the Constitution, while expressly enacting one of the two wellestablished restrictions on the exercise of the right of eminent domain, left the other to be imported from the common law.of the legislative heads mentioned above.Finally, I do not see why the taking over of the arrears of rent, in the context of the acquisition of zamindaries, is not for a public purpose.Entry 33 in List I Union List of the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution speaks of acquisition or requisition ing of property for the purposes of the Union.The statute ,. ..horn of all its incidents, the simple definition of the power to acquire compulsorily or of the term eminent domain is the power of the sovereign to take property for public use.The fact of the matter is the zemin dars lost the battle in the last round when this Court upheld the constitutionality of the Amendment Act which the Provisional Parliament enacted with the object, among others, of putting an end to this litigation.The dominant purpose of the Act is that of transference to the State of the interests of proprietors and tenureholders in land and of the mortgagees and lessees of such interests including the interests in trees, forests, fisheries, jalkars, ferries, huts, bazars, mines and minerals.That the Act did not contravene article 311 of the Constitution.That the acquisition of the estates and tenures was for a public purpose.In the abseJce of any material to establish the facts, the allegation calls for no consideration.This, in fact, was the burden of the argument before us.h were due to the landlord for a period ante rior to the date of notification under section 31 of the Act, were undoubtedly the property of the landlord, irrespective of his interest in the estate or tenure which is the subjectmatter of acquisition.of the arrears also appears in the chapter headed Assessment of Compensation and, therefore, the fifty per cent.It is the absence of a provision S.The same re marks apply to the acquisition of decrees for arrears of rent.The overriding public purpose of ameliorating the conditions of the cultivating raya may well have induced the Legislature to treat the arrears of rent and the decrees for rent differently from the other ordinary moveable properties of the zamindars or tenureholders, e.With the onward march of civilization our notions as to the scope of the general interest of the community are fast changing and widening with the result that our old and narrower notions as to the sanctity of the private interest of the individual can no longer stem the , forward flowing tide of time and must necessarily give way to the broader notions of the general interest of the community.1952 The State of Bihar v .Payment of compensation, though not an essential ingredient of the connotation of the term, is an essential element of the valid exercise of such power.The suits and the applications were heard together.The result is that the impugned Acts can no longer be attacked on the ground of alleg ed infringement of any of the rights conferred by the provisions of Part III.The pith and substance of the legislation however, in my opinion, is the transference of owner ship of estates to the State Governmeru and falls within the ambit of legislative head entry 36 of Lst II.On the merger of those States in Madhya Pradesh or Uttar Pradesh, as the case may be, by virtue of the covenant of merger entered into between the rulers and the Government of India the properties in question were recognised to be the private property of the Rulers.The last section authorizes the State Government to make rules for carrying out the pro visions of the Act.The arrears of rent, therefore, are the subjectmatter of separate and indi pendent acquisition i1nrler the Rihi.Ambedkar sought to derive them from the spirit of the Constitution.Article 31 4 debars the challenge of the con stitution.The learned Judges of the High Court negatived this conten.Nor could the payment of 50 per cent of the face value of the arrears be regarded as compensa tion for the loss of the total arrears, for refund of one half of a sum of money taken away could never make good the loss of the balance.The use of the word such fully supports this interpretation.The object is, inter alia, to bring the tillers of the soil in direct con tact with the States so as to free them from the clutches of rapacious landlords and make them the masters of their holdings subject to payments of the dues to the State.SUPREME COURT REPORTS 943 proposition of law that property of individuals can not be appropriated by the State under the power of compulsory acquisition for the mere purpose of adding to the revenues of the State.Das that the obligation to pay compensation is implicit in the language of entry 36 of List II of the Seventh Schedule and that the power to take compulsorily raises by implication a right to payment, the power to acquire being inseparable from the obligation to pay compensation, it is necessary to examine briefly the origin of the power of the State on the subject of compulsory acquisition of property.The result of this discussion is that the scope of article 31 4 is limited to the express provisions
